# Booking Driver

The **Booking Driver** module tracks the driver-side status of each dispatched order. It's where the driver's progress — and the proof of pickup/delivery — is recorded against a booking.

Open it from the sidebar: **Driver ➔ Booking Driver**.

## 📋 Updating Driver Status

Each record is tied to a booking and captures:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **ID Booking** | The booking being handled. |
| **Status** | The driver's current status (e.g. on the way, picked up, delivered). |
| **Keterangan** | Notes/remarks about the progress. |
| **Image** | Photo evidence (e.g. proof of pickup or delivery). |

### Steps

1. Locate the booking in the list.
2. Open it and set the appropriate **Status**.
3. Add any **Keterangan** (notes) and upload an **Image** if proof is required.
4. **Save** the update.

The status change is reflected across the system and feeds into [Live Tracking](../tracking/live-tracking.md) and the [Update Status](../report-data/update-status.md) reports.

Encourage drivers to attach a photo at pickup and delivery — it creates an auditable trail for each shipment.
