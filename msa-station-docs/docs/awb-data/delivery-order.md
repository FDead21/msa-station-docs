# Delivery Order (Manifest)

The **Delivery Order** screen manages the manifest-level records used to generate delivery documents. It builds on the booking data and adds the customs/notification details (CN, Pemberitahu) needed to dispatch and document a shipment.

Open it from the sidebar: **AWB Data ➔ Booking Order ➔ Delivery Order**.
