# Update Status

The **Update Status** screens let each operational role advance a shipment's status as it moves through the pipeline. There is a dedicated screen per role so that responsibilities stay clear, plus an **All** view for supervisors.

Open them from the sidebar: **Report Data ➔ Update Status**.

## 🔀 The Five Status Screens

| Screen | Used by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Update Status Admin** | Admin | Advance bookings through administrative checkpoints. |
| **Update Status Handling** | Handling team | Record cargo handling progress. |
| **Update Status Warehouse** | Warehouse | Record warehouse in/out movements. |
| **Update Status Driver** | Driver desk | Record pickup/delivery progress and proof. |
| **Update Status All** | Supervisor | A combined view to update/monitor any status. |

## 📝 Updating a Status (Admin / Handling / Warehouse / All)

1. Open the screen for your role.
2. Find the shipment by its **ID Booking**.
3. Set the new **Status** from the dropdown.
4. Add **Keterangan** (notes) and upload an **Image** if proof is needed.
5. **Save** the update.

## 🚚 Update Status Driver (extra fields)

The driver status screen captures delivery proof in more detail:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **JO Number** | The job order being delivered. |
| **Status** | Driver status (picked up, in transit, delivered, etc.). |
| **Penerima** | Name of the person who received the goods. |
| **Signature** | Recipient's signature capture. |
| **Image** | Photo proof of delivery. |
| **Keterangan** | Notes/remarks. |

After saving, the new status flows through to [Live Tracking](../tracking/live-tracking.md) and the dashboard status counters.

:::tip
Each role should only use its own screen — this keeps the audit trail accurate. Supervisors can use **Update Status All** to correct or monitor any record.
